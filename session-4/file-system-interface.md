Create a JavaScript application that interfaces with a server's file system.  The application should be able
to send files to the server and report the result of this attempt.  Monitoring the health of the server is an
additional concern.  The result of a file upload or a server status notification should be displayed as an "alert"
to the user.  Don't use `window.alert`.  Instead, create a message handler that renders an element in the DOM that
displays the message associated with the event, appropriately color-coded.  These messages should also be logged to the
console, and errors should be sent to an endpoint for further processing.  

The exercise should touch on scope, context, inheritance, and closures.  It will also alow you to create code that
you can improve and evolve over time as you learn more about JavaScript and the tools available to you as a web
developer.
